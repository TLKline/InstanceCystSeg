InstanceCystSeg
==========================

The "InstanceCystSeg" package consists of the source code for the manuscript, "Semantic instance segmentation of kidney cysts in MR images: A fully automated 3D approach developed through active learning". This software is made available so that it may be of use to the scientific and clinical communities. The source codes can be run independently from the command line.

Also included is a python-based image viewer and editing toolkit which provides efficient tools for performing quality checks of resulting segmentations generated by the fully automated approach.
